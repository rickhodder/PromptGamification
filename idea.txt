App name: Promptification

Have fun exploring AI Prompt Engineering Through Gamification

This app will encourage people to improve their prompting skills:
    Weekly/Daily targets for prompts - start with 2 prompts per Daily
    Build a knowledge base of prompts
        Tagged for usage - will help searching - user could review past prompts - I know I had a prompt that did ... and i want to design a one-off or use it as a basis of a new prompt
            - tagged by AI?
            - tagged by User
        Could tag a prompt as a template 
    Attempt to evaluate improvement in prompting - prompts could be rated based on a set of criteria
    Help prepare for interviews


This will be a streamlit web application 
The code will be written in python
LangChain?
Thinking that for now, data will be stored in JSON - good flexible format - in a later phase maybe move to a database/vector store


Use Cases
---------
1. The user will add a new Prompt
    User will have option as to whether they want their prompts viewed by others, or just for their list of prompts - or the user could opt in to share single or multiple prompts with others
    There will be a field for the prompt: it should be in a large text box that is sizable
    There will be a field for showing a suggested prompt supplied by the AI 
    There will be a field for description: it should be in a medium text box
    The user should not be able to run the prompt from within this application
    There will be a field for describing what user thought went wrong - or may better "what i learned" from prompt
    There will be a field for describing what user thought went well with prompt
    There will be a review button that will look at the prompt and the decision
        Knowledgeable Prompting Expert with kind, encouraging, yet cautious (aware of prompt-related security issues like prompt injections) persona,  will review the prompt and description/intent and offer
            A list of clarifying questions to learn more about the what the user was attempting
                The user will be able to optionally answer the questions and the prompt will be modified based on the answers
            A list of refinements that could me made to the prompt - the user could check off each of the refinements they would like applied to the prompt and click review, and it would update the 

2. Another use case would be to help a user create a prompt - using many of the same things mentioned above. 
    Instead of entering a prompt, the user would just put a description of what they want the prompt to do.
        for example the user would be prompted with questions/refinements

3. Interviewer mode
    not totally sure about this
    user is interviewed on prompts
        create a prompt that...
        refine this prompt
        identify issues with this prompt
    Prompt Review
    User is rated on answers

3. Tagging a prompt as a "prompting template" will make it available in #2 above, maybe a drop down that will populate the prompt



Personas
--------
Have several personas that can guide the users as they progress (The user could select which persona they would like to use for the review)
    All would be kind, encouraging, yet cautious (aware of prompt-related security issues like prompt injections)
    A beginning persona very willing to explain things simply, whose questions and refinements arent too technical
    An intermediate persona, gives medium difficulty technical questions and explanations that the user can ask for clarification 
    An advanced persona, gives more difficult technical questions and explanations that the user can ask for clarification
    And finally, as a departure, a less kind/less encouraging persona that gets right to the point and is a bit of a hardass - maybe this could be an interviewer persona that would be like being in an interview to test prompting knowledge        


Tagging
-------

One or more tags can be applied to the prompt
Tagging is optional
AI could suggest tags



Dashboard
---------------

user
    # of prompts over time
    Average ratings over time
    prompt tags breakdown    

prompt
    polar graph based on 
        length
        complexity
        specificity
        clarity
        creativity
        context

testing
-------
Tests should be created for all functionality
There should be an ability to mock the calls to AI so that tests 
    dont drive up AI costs
    can be run 



Patterns
--------
strategy
    personas as strategies that can be snapped in like tools
any other patterns that make sense, but not just for the sake of having patterns

Guidance
--------
Incorporate techniques from "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI" by Oreilly where relevant

Parking Lot, Not sure if this will go in app
---------------
The user will then be able to test the prompt against different AI models
There will be a field for tags: it should allow multiple tags to be added
Maybe AI will rate prompts of user
